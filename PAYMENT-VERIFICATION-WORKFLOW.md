# PAYMENT-INTEGRATED VERIFICATION SYSTEM

## Overview
The Propvet verification system now requires **payment completion before any verification activities can begin**. This ensures a seamless paid service where users pay upfront based on verification type (EXPRESS or NORMAL).

## üîÑ New Workflow

### 1. **User Creates Verification** 
```
POST /verification/create
```
- User provides: `address`, `state`, `type` (EXPRESS/NORMAL), optional `callbackUrl`
- System automatically:
  - Fetches price from VerificationPrice table based on type
  - Creates verification with `PENDING_PAYMENT` status
  - Initializes Paystack payment
  - Returns verification details + Paystack payment URL

**Response includes:**
- `verification` object with payment details
- `payment` object with Paystack authorization URL
- User is redirected to Paystack for payment

### 2. **Payment Processing**
- User completes payment on Paystack
- Paystack redirects to callback URL (optional)
- System verifies payment via webhook or manual verification

### 3. **Payment Verification**
```
POST /verification/verify-payment
```
- Verifies payment status with Paystack
- Updates verification status from `PENDING_PAYMENT` to `PENDING`
- Updates payment_status to `PAID` or `FAILED`

### 4. **Document Upload (Payment Required)**
```
POST /verification/add-document
```
- **Blocked until payment_status = 'PAID'**
- Payment validation middleware checks before allowing upload
- Returns authorization error if payment not completed

### 5. **Admin Actions (Payment Required)**
```
PATCH /verification/update-document-status
POST /verification/add-comment
```
- **Admin cannot review/update until payment is completed**
- Payment validation middleware protects all admin actions
- Ensures no free work is performed

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
**Verification Schema Updates:**
```javascript
{
  status: ['PENDING_PAYMENT', 'PENDING', 'REQUIRES_CLARIFICATION', 'VERIFIED', 'REJECTED'],
  payment_status: ['PENDING', 'PAID', 'FAILED'],
  payment_amount: Number,
  payment_url: String,
  payment_access_code: String,
  payment_reference: String
}
```

### New Use Cases
1. **CreateVerificationWithPaymentUseCase** - Handles verification creation + payment initialization
2. **VerifyPaymentUseCase** - Verifies Paystack payment and updates status

### Middleware Protection
1. **checkPaymentStatus** - Protects user document operations
2. **checkPaymentStatusForAdmin** - Protects admin verification actions

### Payment Integration
- **Paystack Integration**: Automatic payment initialization and verification
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Fetches price based on verification type
- **Payment References**: Unique payment tracking per verification

## üìã API Endpoints

### Core Verification Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Payment Required | Description |
|--------|----------|------|------------------|-------------|
| POST | `/verification/create` | User | No | Creates verification + initiates payment |
| POST | `/verification/verify-payment` | User | No | Verifies payment completion |
| POST | `/verification/add-document` | User | **Yes** | Upload documents (blocked until paid) |
| PATCH | `/verification/update-document-status` | Admin | **Yes** | Update document status (blocked until paid) |
| POST | `/verification/add-comment` | User/Admin | **Yes** | Add comments (blocked until paid) |

### Read-Only Endpoints (No Payment Required)
| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/verification/all` | Admin | Get all verifications |
| GET | `/verification/user/:userId` | User | Get user's verifications |
| GET | `/verification/:verificationId` | User | Get verification details |
| GET | `/verification/:verificationId/timeline` | User | Get verification timeline |

### Pricing Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/verification/set-price` | Admin | Set verification prices |
| GET | `/verification/price` | Public | Get price for specific type |
| GET | `/verification/prices` | Public | Get all verification prices |

## üéØ Business Rules

### Payment Rules
1. **Payment First**: No verification work starts until payment is completed
2. **Type-Based Pricing**: 
   - NORMAL: ‚Ç¶5,000 (default)
   - EXPRESS: ‚Ç¶10,000 (default)
3. **Payment Blocking**: All document uploads and admin actions are blocked until payment
4. **Payment Verification**: Real-time verification with Paystack API

### Status Flow
```
PENDING_PAYMENT ‚Üí (after payment) ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí REQUIRES_CLARIFICATION/VERIFIED/REJECTED
```

### Error Handling
- **401 Unauthorized**: If payment not completed for protected actions
- **400 Bad Request**: If payment verification fails
- **404 Not Found**: If verification not found for payment reference

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
PAYSTACK_SECRET=your_paystack_secret_key
FRONTEND_URL=your_frontend_url
```

### 2. Seed Verification Prices
```bash
node scripts/seed-verification-prices.js
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Create verification ‚Üí Get payment URL
2. Complete payment on Paystack
3. Verify payment ‚Üí Status changes to PENDING
4. Upload documents ‚Üí Should now work
5. Admin can now review documents

## üìä Verification Status Meanings

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING_PAYMENT` | Waiting for user to complete payment |
| `PENDING` | Payment completed, waiting for documents/review |
| `REQUIRES_CLARIFICATION` | Needs additional documents or information |
| `VERIFIED` | All documents approved, verification complete |
| `REJECTED` | Verification rejected by admin |

## üí≥ Payment Status Meanings

| Payment Status | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Payment not yet completed |
| `PAID` | Payment successfully completed |
| `FAILED` | Payment failed or was declined |

## üîß Postman Collection
The updated Postman collection includes:
- Payment-integrated verification creation
- Payment verification endpoint
- Automatic token and reference management
- All endpoints with proper payment validations

This system ensures **no free verification work** is performed and creates a robust **paid service model** with Paystack integration! üéâ
